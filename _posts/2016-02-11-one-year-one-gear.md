It’s been a pretty grotty start to 2016. Relentless rain and driving wind has contributed to a poor offroad riding conditions especially over the chalky patched South Downs. This, of course, is an excuse for my lack of motivation and enthusiasm to “ride regardless”, a term I’d coined to get me in the saddle early and often. It didn’t work.

## The King is dead, long live The King!

Setting myself a general goal of ‘ride more’ was destined for failure. As soon as I missed a single ride I spiraled in to a guilt complex which resulted in excuses to not ride and empty promises to ‘ride all of next week’, which of course was destined for failure considering my current activity.

I’ve now set myself a more forgiving goal: **One year, one gear.**

## Working to constraints

I work well under constraints. I find that once the boundaries have been accepted the processes and goals are clear.

Late 2015 I converted my Orange P7 to a singlespeed. These are my constraints, albeit out of necessity: one year riding a singlespeed mountain bike for **every** ride.

This isn’t an excuse to take it easy either. I still plan to re-ride and complete the SWD in full this year, take part in Big Dog at Stanmer Park and partake in as many social rides as I can.

With this new goal set I’m a bit more opportunistic and slowly getting back into my rhythm.
