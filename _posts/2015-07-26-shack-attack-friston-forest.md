**Friston Forest** in East Sussex had been on the radar for a while and resources like [Friston Forest MTB Singletrack Map](shttp://www.sxmtbstmaps.co.uk/) only fuelled my enthusiasm to visit. But like so may places, it’s easy to miss the sweet spots or accidentally find yourself out of you depth if you haven’t ridden the routes before.

Fortunately the good folks at **[Lewes Cycle Shack](http://lewescycleshack.co.uk/)** had recently announced a guided ride around the many singletracks on offer, courtesy of a few of the regulars from **[Cycle Seahaven](http://cycleseahaven.org.uk/)**.

This had been in the diary for a few weeks now and although the weather forecast went from bad to worse in the upcoming weeks, I wasn’t about to miss this opportunity to finally check out the woodland and shred some of the trials with a group of new riders.

On the day, as always, the British weather didn’t fail to fulfil it’s promise. By the time we were all scheduled to roll out of Seaford train station the rain was in there in bucket loads. This being said spirits were high and everyone was keen to overlook this slight technicality and get exploring.

The group were super friendly: an equal amount of local and Lewes Cycle Shack regular riders made for a great mix of conversation, banter and tips on the day’s riding.

After a short ride from the station to the forest, the group combined with other riders and with the ride leader [Andy (Gus) Lock](http://cycleseahaven.org.uk/ride-leaders-2/)’s word we rolled out.

## What goes up, must come down

First up was [Cardiac](http://www.sxmtbstmaps.co.uk/index.html#Cardiac): a long and slow climb along a gravel path that leads to the fun.

At the top we got took in the view and got our bearings and got a taste of a small section of the trails while other riders arrived a the summit.

A quick head count and we were off down the [Crater run](http://www.sxmtbstmaps.co.uk/index.html#CraterRun) to shed off some the elevation we’d all accumulated.

### Mind Blown

I’d wrongly assumed references to “craters” were simply because of the naturally shaped terrain that had occurred over time. In fact these were bomb craters left during the war that had changed this landscape “unnaturally natural” as someone put it.

For the braver souls, these craters were irresistible. Massive roll-ins with varying technical exit routes looked a lot of fun but not on a first visit.

Connecting these bowls were some really delicious singletrack, each interconnecting section differing from the next; some cramped and technical, some open and lazy.

## Sweet Spots

Before long we were back at the [Candy Canes](http://www.sxmtbstmaps.co.uk/index.html#CandyCanes) and ready to climb the Cardiac again and venture off into another part of the forest.

Hanging left this time we rode what I considered the better routes; [Doris and Bert](http://www.sxmtbstmaps.co.uk/index.html#DorisandBert) and [Snow Run](http://www.sxmtbstmaps.co.uk/index.html#SnowRun).

I got a lot out of riding these two routes. One was getting to ride some berms. Although I’ve ridden the Stanmer Park singletrack quite a bit it’s fairly flat or for want of a better word *bermless* … unless I’ve missed something of course! This was great practice as I’ve done absolutely zero bike park riding and although I felt like I was starting to wash out in places, I think that was a bit down to the weather.

Some of our group got separated so Gus went off to find them, this left Ray to lead us down the Snow Run. Before we started he mentioned a jump between some trees which I couldn’t work out whether he was serious about or not. We pressed on and sure enough there was a few choice little man-made jumps, a couple that led straight into a berm and onto some nice little technical sections.

Exiting not the fire road I was exhilarated, this was exactly the kind of riding I’d hoped the day would offer and I was hungry for more!

### Reunited Rewind

Not long after we’d all made it to the bottom of the run the rest of the group turned up and we’d decided to give [Jamie’s Back Passage](http://www.sxmtbstmaps.co.uk/index.html#JamiesBackpassage) a miss and re-run Doris and Bert and Snow Run for those who had just missed it.

It was really nice to re-ride this section straight away as it was fresh in the mind and gave the opportunity to push a bit on the effort knowing we didn’t have to stop.

## Rounding Up and Rolling Home

By the end of the ride it felt like I was amongst friends. People were obviously thrilled by the day’s riding and gaining the experience of riding the forest. The [Cycle Seahaven](http://cycleseahaven.org.uk/) group were really friendly and openly invited everyone to their [regular rides](http://cycleseahaven.org.uk/calendar/).

After saying our farewells, soaked through to the bone and with no letup from the rain, we headed back to the station to attempt to board a train back to Lewes caked in mud. Somehow, we all managed it.

## Thanks

Aside from the crappy weather, the day was amazing. We really are lucky to have so many fantastic MTB rides in East Sussex, Friston Forest definitely rating up the top. For me it feels like a playground that you could span an awful lot of time in, developing technique and having a lot of fun.

Many thanks to Gus, Ray and all the other local riders for showing us around the singletrack. I’ll definitely be back for more!

Also huge thanks to **Lewes Cycle Shack** for organising the ride in the first place. If you haven’t yet already done so [signed up to the Lewes Cycle Shack newsletter](http://lewescycleshack.co.uk/about-us/shop-rides/) for more details on the shop rides.
