After a few false starts, mechanicals and some serious love from my [LBS](http://www.cycle-shack.co.uk/cycleshack-cliffe.aspx) things are running smoothly and I’m hitting the trails again.

With the guilt of a rather poor show the previous month, the trails finally firming up it was time to crawl back onto the pace I was at before it all went a bit pear-shaped.

So what’s on the menu? It’s a breakfast up the beacon and through Stanmer followed by tea over Coombes Ridge.

The catalyst to all this was setting a few goals in Strava. It turns out doing so is a massive motivation and behavior changer.

Topping it all off was signing off the route for the Lewes MTB club ride I’m co-organizing with [Lewes Cycleshack](http://www.cycle-shack.co.uk/cycleshack-cliffe.aspx) on Sunday 1st May. Get in touch with them if you’re interested in joining in, more details soon. Also UCI downhill champs at Cairns, Australia on Saturday. Nice.
