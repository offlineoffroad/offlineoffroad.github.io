This week was fairly consistent. I’m still getting used to my new regime of school run and trying to fit in a cycle even if it is via the A27 and regardless of the weather. Also I was a little paranoid through the trails this week after reading more reports of tripwires being found and ridden into.

I got a few opportunities to mix up the [Stanmer singletrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE_ECVS_RsI), hanging left one day and right the next and picking up confidence through the narrow sapling arches that got the better of me last week. I really need to do a proper session there with a learned rider who can show me all the things I’m missing.

I almost got to fit in a long ride back from an Async.js meetup in Brighton but just as started the climb into the Stanmer woods my chain snapped and **shock horror** no powerlink in the bag. So if you’re reading this, consider it your reminder to check your kit bag, other endure the 30min wait at the train station like I did.

There were a couple of local organised rides I missed out on too; one with the [Lewes Hike and Bike Festival](http://www.leweshikeandbike.co.uk/) and another by [Lewes Cycle Shack](http://lewescycleshack.co.uk/). The former being an outdoor festival with daily events between 20th May and 21st Jun, the latter running monthly cycle rides around Lewes and the SDW.

Another exciting discovery was the [Ouse Valley Cycle Network](http://ovcnet.ning.com/) which will provide a riverside cycle path from Lewes to Newhaven scheduled for the end of 2015.

Finishing the week off nicely was watching the next stage of the UCI MTB World Cup with the Boy.

Nice!
