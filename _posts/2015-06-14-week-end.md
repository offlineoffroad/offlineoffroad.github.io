This week was fairly consistent. I’m still getting used to my new regime of school run and trying to fit in a cycle even if it is via the A27.

I got a few opportunities to mix up the Stanmer trails, hanging left one day and right the next and picking up confidence through the narrow sapling arches that took me out last week. I still need to do a proper session there with a learned rider who can show me all the things I’m missing.

I’m glad to say the thumb is pretty much back to normal,
