I was introduced to this recipe after inquiring on Twitter about rolling one’s own cycling nutritional snacks and refreshments. I’ve never quite gotten into energy gels because of their intensely artificial and sickly sweet taste. Similarly energy bars, although not as offensive, always seemed a likely candidate for replacing with a homemade savoury alternative.

The tweet finally got picked up by [Alan Colville](http://half-arsedracer.com) who hooked me up with this recipe for savoury rice cakes, otherwise known as “Francois”, that have since become a firm favourite for longer rides. The recipe here is just transcribed from [Dr. Allen Lim’s YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UiuqIWGe_s), so all credit for this recipe goes to him for this wonderful snack.

Thanks again for the tip Alan!

## Ingredients

* Sushi Rice (not quick cook)
* Eggs
* Bacon
* Parmesan

## Method

0. Cook the rice as per instructions
0. Scramble the eggs in nice big chunks
0. Grill the bacon keeping all the delicious fat
0. Once the above three ingredients are cooked, chop the bacon and combine in a 4-5cm deep non-stick baking tray
0. While mixing, grate in the parmesan cheese to taste
0. Press the mixture down in the baking tray and refrigerate
0. Once chilled, chop into pocket sized rectangles and wrap in foil (check the video for foil wrapping tips)

I normally fill the baking tray half deep with the mixture, sprinkle on some chilli flakes, then fill the other half. It gives them a nice kick.
